# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzle solutions in Rust.

I was learning rust along the way so don't take this code as example of idiomatic (or good) Rust code. Most of the time I coded just enough to solve the puzzles, leaving linting errors, printlogs and extra comments behind.
